# WaveVortexModel

WaveVortexModel represents rotating, stratified Boussinesq flow on an energetically orthogonal basis of internal waves, inertial oscillations, geostrophic motions, and mean-density anomalies. It can decompose a fluid state into wave–vortex coefficients, reconstruct physical fields, diagnose the resulting flow, and integrate nonlinear dynamics, with analytical linear evolution available when needed.

## Installation

WaveVortexModel requires MATLAB R2025b or newer. The recommended installation uses [OceanKit](https://github.com/JeffreyEarly/OceanKit) as an MPM repository:

```matlab
mpmAddRepository("OceanKit","local/path/to/OceanKit")
mpminstall("WaveVortexModel")
```

See the [installation guide](https://wavevortexmodel.org/installation) for complete runtime and authoring instructions.

## Quick start

Create a small constant-stratification transform, initialize one internal wave, inspect its velocity field, and advance the state with nonlinear model integration:

```matlab
wvt = WVTransformConstantStratification([40e3 40e3 1000],[16 16 9],N0=5.2e-3,latitude=45);
[omega,k,l] = wvt.initWithWaveModes(kMode=1,lMode=0,j=1,phi=0,u=0.05,sign=1);
[u,v,w] = wvt.variableWithName('u','v','w');

wvt.addForcing(WVAdaptiveDamping(wvt));
model = WVModel(wvt);
model.integrateToTime(600);
```

The transform stores the decomposed state in the wave–vortex coefficients `Ap`, `Am`, and `A0`. Physical variables such as `u`, `v`, `w`, density, pressure, energy, and potential vorticity are reconstructed from those coefficients when requested.
