## Description
Real valued property with dimensions $$(j,kl)$$ and no units.

## Discussion
These projection coefficients map the density-displacement state variable onto $$A_0$$. In the historical notation of [Early et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995), they are the row 3, column 3 entries of $$S^{-1}$$ for the primary internal-gravity-wave and geostrophic solutions in equation C5.

For $$k^2+l^2>0, j>0$$ (from either equation B14 or C5) this is written as,

$$
\textrm{A0N} \equiv \frac{f_0^2}{\omega^2}
$$

in the manuscript. In code this is computed with,

```matlab
fOmega = f./omega;
A0N = fOmega.^2;
```

With a rigid lid the solution at $$k>0, l>0, j=0$$ is from equation B11,

$$
\textrm{A0N} \equiv 0
$$

which in code is,

```matlab
A0N(:,:,1) = 0;
```

The $$k=l=0, j>=0$$ solution is a mean density anomaly,

```matlab
A0N(1,1,:) = 1;
```
