## Discussion
These reconstruction coefficients map $$A_-$$ onto the $$w$$ state variable. In the historical notation of [Early et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995), they are the row 4, column 2 entries of $$S$$ for the primary internal-gravity-wave and geostrophic solutions in equation C4.

For $$k^2+l^2>0, j>0$$ this is written as,

$$
\textrm{WAm} \equiv - i K h
$$

in the manuscript. In code this is computed with,

```matlab
WAm = -sqrt(-1)*Kh.*self.h;
```

There are no $$k^2+l^2>0, j=0$$ wave solutions for a rigid lid,

```matlab
WAm(:,:,1) = 0;
```

The inertial solutions occupy the $$k^2+l^2=0$$ portion of the matrix,

```matlab
WAm(1,1,:) = 0;
```
