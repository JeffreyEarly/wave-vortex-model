#  VA0

matrix component that multiplies $$A_0$$ to compute $$\tilde{v}$$.

> Developer documentation: this item describes internal implementation details.

## Description
Complex valued property with dimensions $$(j,kl)$$ and units of $$s^{-1}$$.

## Discussion
These reconstruction coefficients map $$A_0$$ onto the $$v$$ state variable. In the historical notation of [Early et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995), they are the row 2, column 3 entries of $$S$$ for the primary internal-gravity-wave and geostrophic solutions in equation C4.

For $$k^2+l^2>0, j>0$$ this is written as,

$$
\textrm{VA0} \equiv i \frac{g}{f_0} l
$$

in the manuscript. In code this is computed with,

```matlab
VA0 = sqrt(-1)*(g_/f)*L;
```

There are no $$k^2+l^2>0, j=0$$ wave solutions for a rigid lid,

```matlab
VA0(:,:,1) = 0;
```

The inertial solutions occupy the $$k^2+l^2=0$$ portion of the matrix,

```matlab
VA0(1,1,:) = 0;
```
