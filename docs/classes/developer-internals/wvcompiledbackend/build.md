#  build

Compile, validate, and transactionally install the pinned native provider.

> Developer documentation: this item describes internal implementation details.

## Declaration
```matlab
 capabilities = WVCompiledBackend.build()
```
## Returns
+ `capabilities`  schema `1.0.0` support, identity, validation, storage, build-attempt, and failure information

## Discussion

The build downloads FFTW 3.3.11 from the official archive, verifies its
pinned SHA-256 digest, builds only the NEON/pthreads shared provider, stages
and validates the MEX module, and installs it beside the package root.
Failures are returned in the capability schema and retained as the latest
build attempt.
