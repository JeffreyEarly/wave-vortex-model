## Diagnostics

We also have a suite of diagnostic tools that can be used to analyze model output. The [WVDiagnostics](https://energy-pathways-group.github.io/wave-vortex-model-diagnostics/) class is not as robust and user-friendly as the model itself, but you may find some useful starting points for your own analysis.

## AlongTrackSimulator

There is also an online [AlongTrackSimulator](https://satmapkit.github.io/AlongTrackSimulator/) for the WaveVortexModel, which will sample the sea-surface height of your model using any one of the current or historical altimeters.
