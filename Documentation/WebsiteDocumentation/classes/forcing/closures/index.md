#  Closures

Closures are forcing operations that remove small scale features from the flow. See the [users guide on adding forcing](/users-guide/adding-forcing.html).

### Notes
 - All forcing operations are a subclass of [WVForcing](/classes/forcing/wvforcing/).
 - The word *viscosity* is reserved for $$\nu$$ which acts on the momentum equations.
 - The word *diffusivity* is reserved for $$\kappa$$ which acts on the thermodynamic equation.
 - The word *damping* is a catchall term that applies to any small scale feature removal.
