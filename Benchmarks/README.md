# Benchmarks

This folder contains authoring-only performance tools and historical profiling scripts. It is not included on the WaveVortexModel runtime package path.

## Reproducible benchmark suites

`runWaveVortexBenchmark` is the canonical performance and memory entry point. It measures a state-advanced `nonlinearFlux()` call while retaining ordinary production caches. State changes use the public `t`, `Ap`, `Am`, and `A0` setters; the runner never clears the variable cache explicitly.

```matlab
addpath("Benchmarks")
results = runWaveVortexBenchmark(suites="core-v1")
```

The registered suites are:

- `smoke-v1`: small cases for every transform family; no score.
- `core-v1`: the canonical constant-stratification nonlinear-advection score.
- `scaling-standard-v1`: standard horizontal and vertical scaling across transform families.
- `scaling-large-v1`: fixed large-memory scaling cases.
- `transform-layout-v1`: an unscored diagnostic of full-complex WV/DFT mapping expressions. It compares the current WV-sorted linear mapping with DFT-sorted, two-dimensional-row, and per-plane alternatives while preserving production behavior.

The runner accepts more than one suite and a subset of case IDs. Suite definitions are versioned in `waveVortexBenchmarkSuites`; changing a case matrix or score definition requires a new suite version. Backends are selected independently from transform families through `waveVortexBenchmarkBackends`.

Every scored case is normalized against its matching committed builtin reference. Case score 100 matches the reference. Family and suite scores use geometric means, with transform families weighted equally. Same-host builtin-to-candidate speedups are reported separately.

Ordinary artifacts are written beneath the ignored `results/runs` directory. Immutable reference artifacts live beneath `results/reference`. Memory measurements use a fresh MATLAB process and report baseline, persistent, and peak-observed resident memory; these process measurements include MATLAB runtime and allocator behavior.

The large suites can require substantial time and memory. A partial result is valid, but a family or suite receives no aggregate score unless every required case completes.

The transform-layout suite uses the same artifact entry point but does not participate in benchmark scores or fresh-process memory measurement:

```matlab
results = runWaveVortexBenchmark(suites="transform-layout-v1")
```

It measures extraction, primary insertion, conjugate insertion, combined insertion, and complete horizontal forward/inverse calls. Each strategy owns and reuses a persistent full-complex buffer. Array setup and mapping construction are excluded, while indexing, allocation, conjugation, reshape, transpose, and MATLAB copy-on-write behavior inherent to each expression remain timed. The strict winner has the smallest median; the production `wv-sorted-linear` strategy remains preferred when it is within 3% of that median. MATLAB pointer and copy state is reported as unavailable because no supported API exposes it for these expressions. Whole-process memory comparisons remain separate from this suite.

Issue #70 moved the builtin adapter to a row-oriented Fourier-storage layout. Its integration gate compares the production adapter—not a stand-alone approximation—with the immutable issue #69 medians:

```matlab
results = runWVFourierStorageLayoutIntegrationBenchmark
```

The 3% regression threshold applies only to `[256 256 65]` and `[512 512 129]`, with antialiasing both disabled and enabled. Smaller cases remain descriptive because the row layout was selected as the single production representation even where MATLAB timing noise or fixed overhead can make a legacy expression faster. The integration artifact predates removal of the vertically replicated compatibility properties; the historical suite now constructs equivalent expanded indices during untimed setup through `indicesFromWVGridToDFTGrid`, while its immutable canonical artifact remains unchanged.

The v4.2.1 release audit repeated this gate against the final production source. Its immutable M5 Max/R2026a builtin result is stored under `results/reference/transform-layout-v4.2.1-release-m5-max-r2026a-builtin`.

## Builtin transform storage

`runWaveVortexBuiltinStorageBenchmark` reports exact application-owned transform arrays and repeated externally sampled process RSS without assuming that MATLAB allocation behavior can be inferred from source code:

```matlab
addpath("Benchmarks")
results = runWaveVortexBuiltinStorageBenchmark
```

`runWaveVortexRetirementBenchmark` compares archived `v4.2.1` and candidate source snapshots in three fresh processes per `core-v1` case. Each worker rotates implementation order, records the required 7/3 within-process samples, compares the final numerical outputs, and proves that the builtin adapter executed. The same command includes the generic storage/RSS benchmark in its retirement artifact.

The ledger covers compact Fourier mappings, the reused builtin inverse buffer, dense vertical transform matrices, and known forward/inverse result arrays. MATLAB-internal FFT work storage remains explicitly opaque. Each case runs in three fresh MATLAB processes by default while ordinary production caches stay warm.

`WVTransformConstantStratificationSpeedTest`, `ProfileableSpeedTest`, and `ForcingSpectralMaskPerformanceTest` remain historical investigation scripts. Deterministic correctness checks belong in `UnitTests`; mixed scientific investigations belong in `DeveloperExperiments`.

## Compiled transform components

`runCompiledKernelTransformBenchmark` measures the issue #49/#50 portable C++ transform core through an authoring-only MEX gateway. It compares complete forward projection, inverse reconstruction, and fused F/G value-plus-derivative calls with MATLAB. The gateway links locally to the active MATLAB installation's FFTW library; no MEX product or FFTW library is tracked. Component speedups are descriptive and do not decide whether the later nonlinear kernel is ready.

`runCompiledKernelPhaseOnceBenchmark` compares the isolated kernel baseline at commit `199c9b8` with the current candidate in fresh processes. It verifies that ordinary `nonlinearFlux` evaluates its time-dependent phase exactly once per `[Nj,Nkl]` coefficient while reporting complete timing, exact live storage, and peak RSS. The benchmark creates and removes a temporary detached worktree for the baseline; it never modifies `main`.

`runCompiledKernelNativeFFTWBenchmark` establishes the standalone kernel's Apple-silicon FFT foundation. It builds checksum-pinned FFTW 3.3.11 variants in the ignored `.fftw-cache/issue137` directory, verifies the loaded base, thread, and optional OpenMP libraries, screens thread counts, and fully samples the finalists in fresh MATLAB processes. The benchmark measures the kernel-only and complete MEX times for forward projection, inverse reconstruction, F/G derivative reconstruction, and ordinary `nonlinearFlux`. Its global selection uses the geometric mean across all four `core-v1` cases and chooses the simpler configuration when speed and peak RSS are within 3%.

`runCompiledKernelCoefficientAssemblyConfirmationBenchmark` verifies the clean issue #126 reconstruction against that committed issue #137 baseline. It uses the selected native NEON/pthreads provider and 18 FFTW threads, preserves all three fresh-process runs and 7/3 samples, and requires contract-v4 execution metadata. The experimental issue #126 branch remains the component-ablation record; the clean confirmation proves that only the adopted natural-dimensional pre-scaling, straight-line assembly/projection, native compiler settings, and two-worker coefficient stages were transferred.

`runCompiledKernelAssemblyDecisionBenchmark` records issue #131's final timing, correctness, provider, and lifecycle evidence. Its original memory fields are superseded because the MATLAB exact ledger omitted nonlinear-flux caches and the compiled RSS phase included a later MATLAB reference call.

`runCompiledKernelMemoryReassessmentBenchmark` corrects only that memory comparison. MATLAB and compiled operations run in separate fresh processes with explicit common-model, backend, operation, outputs-held, and cleanup phases. Exact retained storage includes active backend arrays, reachable MATLAB variable-cache arrays, and three flux outputs; MATLAB temporaries and FFT plan allocations remain opaque and are covered by isolated operation-only RSS. The reassessment imports the frozen issue #131 speed evidence rather than rerunning it.

The OpenMP screen builds LLVM `libomp` 22.1.8 locally from its verified official source archive. It gives the experimental runtime a unique install identity so MATLAB's already-loaded OpenMP runtime cannot satisfy the native FFTW dependency accidentally. The repository distributes and tracks no FFTW source, LLVM source, native library, build cache, or MEX binary.
