# Prepared projection and assembly pipeline results

The selected candidate is commit `ed6049a2504dad833e93c9221b66ea68db1ac404`, based on the merged PR #494 baseline at `f65ebf684a403742ed27775de0a2c2aac4a1e2fe`. It keeps the existing FFT, vertical matrix, coefficient, phase, and cache representations. Boussinesq skips the unused horizontal-divergence modal write when vertical velocity is present, consumes the vertical-velocity divergence contribution in the final wave-coefficient loop, and runs the remaining projection, coefficient-assembly, and wave-plus-balanced addition loops on the existing synchronous pointwise executor. Hydrostatic runs its projected-field coefficient loop on that executor. Every worker range owns disjoint coefficients, and cache readiness is published only after a joined assembly or after both vertical products and the joined wave-plus-balanced addition complete.

The resident RHS screens support this candidate, and correctness qualification passes. Production adoption remains pending: background host activity invalidated clean timing acceptance, so the full-model campaign was stopped with all completed comparisons preserved.

## Profile basis

The fresh Boussinesq baseline profile used the accepted native tiled pipeline on the `256 x 256 x 129` no-observer fixture. One resident kernel ran 120 timed RHS evaluations with a median of 85.66 ms while macOS sampling was active. Kernel preparation took 2.71 s after a 9.09 s checkpoint load. The profile attributed main-thread and summed active samples as follows:

| Category | Main thread | Summed active |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| BLAS library | 26.66% | 30.20% |
| FFT library | 19.16% | 38.33% |
| Field assembly and derivative arithmetic | 13.66% | 2.74% |
| Tiled adapter and advection arithmetic | 11.71% | 23.95% |
| Wait | 7.99% | — |
| Phase preparation | 6.64% | 1.16% |
| Projection pointwise arithmetic | 6.47% | 1.13% |
| Other runtime and control | 3.93% | 1.16% |
| State validation | 2.83% | 0.49% |
| Matrix adapter and packing | 0.95% | 0.84% |

Main-thread samples help identify serial work and waits; summed active samples describe aggregate CPU work across workers. Neither alone establishes the full dependency critical path. They cannot be added or treated as interchangeable speedup budgets. The inclusive `projectSpectralFields` and `reconstruct` shares were 18.58% and 35.97%, respectively, but both include downstream vertical matrix work. The selected change only targets their pointwise portions.

## Resident RHS screens

Each Boussinesq stage used two already prepared native workers and the same fixture, compiler, Accelerate matrix backend, pinned FFTW libraries, one FFTW thread, twelve horizontal workers, eight pointwise workers, and eight vertical-group workers. The Hydrostatic screen used its EddyTide fixture and one vertical-group worker with the other execution settings unchanged. Eight counterbalanced blocks each contained two warmups and 24 timed fresh-scope RHS calls. Ratios pair neighboring opposite-order blocks; values below one favor the candidate.

| Screen | Cumulative change | Geometric mean ratio | Reduction | Four paired ratios | Maximum flux difference | Maximum field difference | Reported kernel bytes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Boussinesq fusion | Remove the dead `U` write and fuse the stored divergence addition into final projection | 0.98193 | 1.81% | 0.9859, 0.9795, 0.9791, 0.9832 | `2.29e-21` | Not compared across roles | 4,222,276,248 |
| Boussinesq parallel | Fusion plus pointwise projection ranges and wave-plus-balanced addition | 0.93943 | 6.06% | 0.9343, 0.9379, 0.9425, 0.9430 | `2.54e-21` | `1.33e-15` | 4,222,276,248 |
| Boussinesq assembly | Parallel stage plus pointwise coefficient assembly | 0.88192 | 11.81% | 0.8881, 0.8750, 0.8799, 0.8847 | `2.54e-21` | `1.55e-15` | 4,222,276,248 |
| Hydrostatic projection | Pointwise projected-field coefficient loop | 0.92522 | 7.48% | 0.9304, 0.9353, 0.9261, 0.9093 | `1.78e-22` | `2.84e-14` | 281,630,917 |

Every cross-role comparison that was performed passed the existing `atol=1e-12`, `rtol=1e-10` scientific gate. Within-role replay differences were zero. Every strengthened screen retained matching storage and producer counters between roles. A 24-sample Boussinesq block recorded 24 state validations, 24 phase preparations, 24 tiled nonlinear executions, 96 coefficient assemblies, 192 vertical preparations, 576 vertical-operator executions, and 567,240 matrix-group executions for each role. The Hydrostatic block likewise retained 24 validations, 24 phases, 24 tiled executions, 96 assemblies, 168 vertical preparations, and 240 vertical-operator executions.

The first fusion-only screen predates the strengthened physical-field payload comparison and driver provenance checks. It compared complete flux payloads and checked each role's fields for finiteness and repeatability, but did not compare fields across roles. The later Boussinesq stages contain that fusion unchanged and compare both complete flux and complete fields, so the final cumulative candidate has the stronger evidence. The baseline runtime source is identical across the old and strengthened harness binaries; their executable identities differ because the strengthened worker writes one field payload per role.

## Benchmark throughput and limits

Resident workers make this staged search practical without changing the timed operation. A Boussinesq screen completed 192 timed RHS calls and 16 warmups in 43–45 s, including about 20.4 s to load and prepare the two workers and about 5.6 s of untimed output validation. Keeping both workers resident avoided six additional checkpoint-load and kernel-preparation cycles of roughly ten seconds each. The Hydrostatic screen completed the same 208 total calls in 4.13 s, including 2.07 s of timed RHS work and 1.30 s of untimed validation. These are harness-throughput observations, not model speedups, and loading, preparation, validation, forcing schedules, integration, and output remain outside the RHS ratios.

The strengthened driver verifies immutable input, executable, provider, worker, CMake, and driver hashes before and after a campaign. It rejects differing compiler, provider, execution options, backend, schedule, producer counts, or numerical outputs. Complete field payloads are compared in chunks and then removed only after success, with their hashes and comparison results retained; flux payloads remain in the archive. The six driver tests pass with NumPy and with the standard-library comparison path.

Host journals record intermittent background work, including antivirus services in several screens, system intelligence activity in the fusion screen, and Time Machine activity in the parallel screen. All four paired ratios in every stage favored the candidate, but these short screens have no confidence interval and are sensitive to host scheduling. The Hydrostatic process lasted only about four seconds and is especially dependent on sparse host observations. The separately sampled baseline's 85.66 ms median includes profiler overhead and must not be compared directly with the unsampled 72–74 ms Boussinesq block means.

## Verification before full-model qualification

- All 50 PortableRuntime Release tests and all eight compiled-kernel tests passed.
- The prepared executor plus Hydrostatic and Boussinesq kernel tests passed under AddressSanitizer.
- The changed Hydrostatic and Boussinesq translation units compiled warning-clean with GCC 14. The known Apple deployment-target warning remains unrelated to this source.
- The stored-divergence arithmetic oracle passed exact-bit comparison under Apple Clang and GCC 14 for both `hasW` paths, including inertial modes, signed zeros, cancellation, extreme finite operands, and odd tails. GCC required the current Xcode macOS 26.5 SDK because its older default SDK headers are incompatible with this host toolchain.
- Focused Boussinesq kernel contracts passed after the fusion, parallel, and assembly stages, and focused Hydrostatic kernel contracts passed after its projection change.

## Alternatives retained as history

The candidate deliberately avoids a new matrix or coefficient layout. Earlier Hydrostatic screens found direct strided and packed vDSP assembly about 3.7 and 3.0 times the scalar loop on EddyTide, with 32 or 128 extra bytes per coefficient; the larger case was slower still. Accelerate has no public variable-size grouped GEMM batch that removes the cost of packing these heterogeneous vertical products, and direct split-real matrix views plus the existing vertical group executor are already selected. Repeating those packing and vDSP routes would add traffic and storage to solve a pointwise scheduling problem.

A coordinated multi-field `u/v/w` assembly could reduce factor traversals, and a phase-adjusted factor layout could expose more vector work, but either would add producer, cache, demand, or retained-storage obligations. The current loops use existing buffers and workers and already remove most of the measured pointwise gap. Vector phase preparation was also screened previously: its remaining gain was small, changed scalar-libm results by several ulps, and required special reference-time handling. None of those larger changes is needed for this increment. FFT, BLAS, and tiled advection remain the dominant summed active work and should be assessed from a new post-adoption profile rather than inferred from these loop screens.

## Full-model qualification: correctness passes, timing pending

The frozen campaign ran from 20:22:45 to 20:34:05 UTC on September 12, 2026 against the exact accepted #494 runner. It completed two warmup pairs plus eight measured pairs for EddyTide and larger Hydrostatic, then two Boussinesq warmup pairs. All 22 completed full-model comparisons passed the existing scientific tolerances and exact integration-decision checks. Evaluator/actual-producer records, retained owned bytes and maximum-live owned bytes were identical in every completed pair. This is reuse-policy evidence; no low-memory storage or timing qualification is claimed.

| Fixture | Completed measured pairs | Provisional candidate/baseline integration ratio | Provisional paired bootstrap 95% interval | Status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| EddyTide `256 x 256 x 28`, RK78 | 8 | 0.93854 | 0.92945–0.94639 | 6.15% observed reduction; host-contaminated |
| Composite Hydrostatic `256 x 256 x 129`, RK4 | 8 | 0.98628 | 0.85675–1.13232 | Inconclusive; strong order effect and host activity |
| Boussinesq `256 x 256 x 129`, RK78 | 0 | — | — | Two correctness warmup pairs passed; timing incomplete |

The idle preflight passed, but the host journal subsequently recorded unrelated Photos, indexing, backup and other activity above the preflight's 10% CPU threshold. All measured Hydrostatic pairs had at least one such observation within conservative request-to-receipt windows. These windows include output hashing, and `ps` percentages are sampled averages rather than continuous instantaneous measurements. They establish a host-quality concern; they do not quantify precisely how much each integration was affected. The bootstrap intervals summarize those observations and cannot remove the contamination or order effect.

The coordinator stopped the remaining campaign instead of completing expensive repeats that could not establish quiet-host acceptance. Both Boussinesq warmup comparisons were already complete; the newly started first measured baseline was interrupted and remains unqualified. No experiment or system service was stopped. No samples were discarded based on measured speed. The archive retains completed runs, comparisons, host observations, the explicit operator-stop record and the partial run. Candidate/baseline executable and provider hashes passed postflight verification.

The 14 focused MATLAB parity/integration tests and all six forward/restart configurations under both providers passed. Source-linked receipts were collected from the frozen runner/probe; all eight strict catalog tests and the repository/provenance checker passed. Scientific source and compiled inputs remained unchanged after `ed6049a2`.

## Adoption decision and next increment

Keep this candidate as a draft until a quiet-host full-model campaign passes; do not enable auto-merge from the provisional ratios. Reuse the frozen binaries, fixtures and completed compiler/scientific evidence. A new timing campaign should use a clean detached worktree at `ed6049a2` for the driver's source identity, a separately frozen copy of the campaign script pointing to that worktree, and a fresh output directory. Run disposable output and journals outside the indexed workspace (for example under `/private/tmp`) and archive them afterward; this reduces potential interaction with workspace indexing but is not proof of host idleness. Check host quality between pairs and stop early if it fails, preserving completed evidence. Do not rebuild or rerun the broad scientific suite merely because timing needs a new host window.

After adoption, reprofile the accepted candidate before choosing a larger matrix-to-horizontal layout or coordinated `u/v/w` refactor. The present change uses existing workers and buffers and requires no new coefficient representation. Remaining gains should be justified against the now-smaller serial assembly/projection cost.
