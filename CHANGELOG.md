# Version History

## [Unreleased]

- Added benchmark-selected spatial derivative dispatch. Complete-call measurements retain dense vertical differentiation and MATLAB horizontal derivatives except at exact validated FFTW size/order records, while selected constant-stratification G-family reconstructions apply horizontal and vertical modal multipliers before inverse transforms without persistent spectrum buffers.
- Added eligibility-aware DCT-I/DST-I dispatch for constant-stratification transforms. The optional FFTW backend now reuses validated real-to-real plans only inside the exact FFTWTransforms issue #43 size and batch intervals, while every other vertical operation retains the existing dense matrix result.
- Added `FFTWTransforms ^1.0.2` and an explicitly opt-in `fastTransform="fftw"` path for constant-stratification transforms. Backend discovery, validated local building, and safe fallback now pass through the static layout-neutral constructor on `WVFastTransformDoublyPeriodic`; builtin remains the default and persisted files do not encode machine capability.
- Replaced vertically replicated horizontal Fourier mappings with compact two-dimensional row mappings while preserving the canonical WaveVortex coefficients. On the Apple M5 Max/R2026a reference run, complete builtin forward transforms were 1.06x–2.00x faster and inverse transforms were 1.81x–3.58x faster across the `[256 256 65]` and `[512 512 129]` gate cases with antialiasing on and off; numerical results remained equivalent within the benchmark tolerance. See the issue #70 `transform-layout-integration-v1` artifact for the machine-specific measurements.
- Rewrote the README, homepage, installation instructions, and user guidance around the current `WVTransform` and `WVModel` workflows; completed the NetCDF conventions guide; linked the canonical wavevortexmodel.org site prominently; and adopted the Avenir-first website typography while retaining search.
- Reorganized the generated API reference around user tasks, moved implementation machinery into Developer Topics, replaced release-status jargon with direct descriptions of capabilities and limitations, and restored authored scientific context, coefficient-occupancy tables, and design rationale.
- Corrected the `WVTransform` and `WVModel` API reference, promoted the stored and time-evaluated wave-vortex coefficients, and classified low-level projection and reconstruction arrays as Developer reference.
- Made documentation generation clean, deterministic, transactional, and reviewable with an exact ClassDocumentation 1.3.0 authoring dependency, canonical build/check tasks, generated hierarchy validation, and case-sensitive internal-route checks.
- Quarantined disconnected legacy implementations, corrected low-level adaptive-integrator and geometry spelling, retained a narrow 4.x file fallback for `shouldExludeConjugates`, and repaired the retained barotropic FINUFFT development path.
- Stabilized model-output scheduling and NetCDF restart across multiple files and groups; preserved linear dynamics and shared observing systems; and made initialization, writing, restoration, and handle ownership exception-safe.
- Made operation registration, replacement, and removal atomic and identity-based; corrected multiple-output lookup; and made cache invalidation follow each operation's declared time and coefficient dependencies.
- Made forcing registration identity-based, deterministic, and atomic; preserved vertical-diffusivity, fixed-amplitude, and explicit-antialias configurations through resolution changes and NetCDF restoration; and rejected vertical diffusivity on barotropic transforms.
- Corrected observing-system ownership and composition, linear-time flux evaluation, particle tolerance and tracked-field propagation, and periodic one-based mooring indexing.
- Added compact invariant coverage across every transform family on even and odd grids; corrected parity-aware Nyquist and Hermitian bookkeeping, vector mode/index mappings, coefficient-preserving resolution conversion, and barotropic spatial energy and enstrophy diagnostics.
- Generalized `summarizeDegreesOfFreedom` across every transform family with deterministic grid metadata and primary-component mask counts.
- Implemented deterministic total-flow analytical-solution lookup across primary components and repaired barotropic mode-index conversion used by that lookup.
- Implemented `hasMeanPressureDifference` as an MDA-only boundary diagnostic with a `1e-5` relative pressure tolerance; other flow components and transforms without an MDA component return `false`.
- Completed the vertical-calculus contract: first through fourth derivatives now use ordinary MATLAB order and grid-layout validation, and all three-dimensional transforms provide first antiderivatives with documented G-space projection and bottom-zero conventions.
- Restricted public field and particle interpolation to periodic `linear` and `spline` methods and removed the dead `exact` and off-grid dispatch.
- Documented the v4.2.1 capabilities and limitations, including the five transform families, latitude domain of `5 <= abs(latitude) <= 85`, MATLAB builtin FFTs, fixed and adaptive integration, and periodic `linear` and `spline` interpolation.
- Enforced the supported latitude domain and restored a deterministic, order-independent green test baseline with isolated random state and temporary files.
- Corrected combined random-flow initialization to preserve conjugate inertial `Ap` and `Am` coefficients.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-07-30
- Added `WVPseudoTopographicWaveGeneration` with Darwin-symbol or custom-frequency initialization, adaptive-damping-aware spectral masking, resolution conversion, restart persistence, and deterministic Goff abyssal-hill generation.
- Made transform restoration read-only by default, eliminated hidden duplicate NetCDF handles, and made one-output restoration close its file before returning.
- Changed model restart to complete read-only restoration before acquiring its single writable output handle, and made model output closure explicitly release that handle.
- Fixed horizontal and vertical Laplacian damping to preserve configured viscosity and diffusivity across transform resolution changes, and made vertical damping support constant-stratification transforms by using the exact zero stratification-gradient correction.

## [4.1.1] - 2026-07-26
- Added `waveModeVerticalStructureAtIndex` with optimized wave F and vertical-derivative G endpoint factors for constant-stratification, hydrostatic, and Boussinesq geometries; fixed constant-stratification resolution and explicit-antialias conversions to preserve `N0` and `isHydrostatic`.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-07-24
- registered flow components now automatically expose supported standard and sea-surface variables.
- added flow-component diagnostics for `pi`, `ssh`, `ssu`, and `ssv`, and corrected component pressure to use the selected component rather than total pressure height.
- added periodic two-dimensional interpolation support for surface fields while preserving three-dimensional interpolation behavior.
- added focused tests for composed-component closure and linear two- and three-dimensional interpolation across periodic boundaries.

## [4.0.7] - 2026-05-06
- raised the `InternalModes` dependency floor to `1.3.0` and the `SplineCore` dependency floor to `^2.2.0`.
- added `chebfun` as a direct dependency for the model's direct chebfun helper usage.
- migrated the `eta_true` spline fit to the `SplineCore` 2.x `BSpline` constructor, knot, and basis-matrix APIs.
- modernized WaveVortexModel's `InternalModes` call sites to the lowerCamel mode and quadrature APIs, including the new `modesAtQuadraturePoints` helper.

## [4.0.6] - 2026-05-06
- raised the `ClassAnnotations` and `NetCDF` dependency floors so OceanKit installs resolve the NetCDF function-handle serialization support required by annotated persistence.
- fixed `WVAdaptiveDamping` for `WVTransformConstantStratification` by routing `effectiveJMax` through the constant-stratification geometry superclass.
- fixed constant-stratification `rhoFunction` and `N2Function` handles so they preserve the shape of caller-provided `z` arrays.
- added `zeta_x` and `zeta_y` as known variables for `WVTransformConstantStratification`, matching the hydrostatic and Boussinesq transforms.
- restored `fluxForForcing` on `WVTransformConstantStratification` so diagnostics can compute forcing flux summaries.
- added constant-stratification `F_g` and `G_g` spectrum/cross-spectrum helpers needed by diagnostics.

## [4.0.5] - 2026-05-06
- changed `shouldUseTrueNoMotionProfile` to be a post-initialization setting that is not accepted by constructors or persisted through NetCDF round trips, while preserving transform-copy behavior and invalidating only the `rho_nm` cache when toggled.

## [4.0.4] - 2026-04-22
- added `shouldUseTrueNoMotionProfile` to the constant-stratification, hydrostatic, and Boussinesq transforms so `eta_true` uses `rho_nm0` by default and `rho_nm` when explicitly requested.
- added an advisory `EtaTrueOperation:OptimizationToolboxUnavailable` warning when `shouldUseTrueNoMotionProfile=true` and `rho_nm` is being computed without Optimization Toolbox support.
- added focused tests covering `eta_true` profile selection, warning behavior, transform-copy preservation, and NetCDF round-trip persistence of `shouldUseTrueNoMotionProfile`.
- changed `WVTransform.version` to read from `resources/mpackage.json` instead of a hard-coded version string so runtime metadata stays aligned with the package manifest.

## [4.0.3] - 2026-04-22
- pinned `InternalModes` to `1.0.1` so MPM resolves a `SplineCore`-compatible dependency set for `WaveVortexModel` installs.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-01-16
- new moment based algorithm for computing rho_nm.
- eta_true now computed from high order spline representation of rho_nm; recores SplineCore package.
- added placeParticlesOnIsopycnals function to all WVStratification subclasses.
